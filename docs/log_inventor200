## 2025/05/28 -- keepammo parameter added

I have recently been physically disabled by a chronic injury
and I'm unable to use my desktop. Instead, I'm only
physically able to use a mini-computer in the closet, which
does not have the RAM or processing power to handle most
OpenGL-based Doom ports. A family member wanted to spend
time with me, and wanted to learn how to play Doom via coop.
They tend to die a lot, but the main thing that bothers them
is the loss of ammo. The losses of armor and weapons feel
fair to them, but losing ammo makes them feel like the team
as a whole is being punished for having a new player.

So I decided to adjust the source code to add an option for
keeping ammo after death, and so they will feel less
frustrated while keeping me company.

I am very thankful for the existence of the Woof! port.
