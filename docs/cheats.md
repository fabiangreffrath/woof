## Changed Doom cheats

`IDBEHOLD`  
Typing IDBEHOLD will bring up a small menu where you can choose to enable one of various powerup effects. To choose a powerup, use the following keys:  
`R`: Toggles radiation suit  
`I`: Toggles partial invisibility  
`V`: Toggles invulnerability (with inverse colormap)  
`A`: Toggles all-map cheat (reveals the automap)  
`L`: Toggles lite-amp goggles  
`S`: Toggles berserk strength  
`H`: Gives 200% health points  
`M`: Gives megaarmor, with 200% armor points  
`O`: Disables all currently active power-ups  

`IDMUSx` now works across netgames and is remembered by savegame.

`IDKFA` and `IDFA` now includes backpack.

## Boom and MBF cheats

In Boom, many of them had a TNT prefix, which was removed in MBF.

`COMPx`  
Show current [complevel](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Woof!#Compatibility_modes). If you type a number, the engine will switch to this complevel. Not safe, for full compatibility set complevel in the menu and restart the level.

`KILLEM`  
This cheat kills all monsters on the map. If there are no enemy monsters on the map and you type this, it will kill all friends on the map (not including the player, of course).

`FAST`  
Toggles fast monsters.

`SMART`  
Toggles smart monsters (the "remember previous enemy" option in the Enemies menu).

`HOM`  
This cheat toggles the Boom [HOM](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Hall_of_mirrors_effect) detection feature. Depending on your settings, HOM will appear either as solid red or as a red flashing area when this cheat is enabled.

`KEY`  
Type KEY to bring up a menu, then type `R`, `Y`, or `B` to choose a key color (red, yellow, or blue). Then, type `C` or `S` to select card or skull. Once you make the final selection, the key will either be given to you if you don't have it, or it will be taken away. This lets you select the key you need (especially useful in maps with missing keys).

`WEAP`  
Type WEAP, then type a number (`1-9` in Doom 2, `1-8` in Doom). The selected weapon which is associated with that slot will either be added or removed, depending on whether you have it or not.

`AMMO`  
Type AMMO, then either type a number from `1-4`, or `B` for Backpack. The selected ammo will be added or taken away. Ammo types are bullets, shells, rockets, and cells.

`TRAN` or `MBFRAN`  
This code toggles translucency rendering effects.

`PITCH`  
Toggles pitched sounds (the "pitch-shifted sounds" option in General menu).

`ICE`  
Toggle Boom friction effects.

`PUSH`  
Toggle Boom pusher effects.

`NUKE`  
Toggle the effects of damaging sectors.

## New Woof! cheats

Most of them were taken from ZDoom, Crispy Doom and DSDA-Doom.

`SPECHITS`  
Triggers all [Linedef actions](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Linedef_type) on a map at once, no matter if they are enabled by pushing, walking over or shooting, or if they require a key. It also triggers all boss monster and Commander Keen actions if possible.

`BUDDHA`  
Makes the player's health unable to drop below 1% from damage taken (toggle on/off).

`NOTARGET`  
Toggle deaf and blind monsters that do not act until attacked.

`FREEZE`  
Stops all monsters, projectiles and item animations, but not the player animations. Additionally allows the player to harmlessly walk through frozen projectile attacks (toggle on/off).

Centers the automap around the lowest numbered unfound secret sector. If used again, it will center the automap around the next unfound secret sector, and so on.

Centers the automap around the lowest numbered alive monster that counts towards the kill percentage. If used again, it will center the automap around the next alive monster, and so on.
