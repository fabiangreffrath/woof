## Boom and MBF cheats

In Boom, many of them had a TNT prefix, which was removed in MBF.

`KILLEM`  
This cheat kills all monsters on the map. If there are no enemy monsters on the map and you type this, it will kill all friends on the map (not including the player, of course).

`FAST`  
Toggles fast monsters.

`SMART`  
Toggles smart monsters (the "remember previous enemy" option in the Enemies menu).

`HOM`  
This cheat toggles the Boom [HOM](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Hall_of_mirrors_effect) detection feature. Depending on your settings, HOM will appear either as solid red or as a red flashing area when this cheat is enabled.

`KEY`  
Type KEY to bring up a menu, then type `R`, `Y`, or `B` to choose a key color (red, yellow, or blue). Then, type `C` or `S` to select card or skull. Once you make the final selection, the key will either be given to you if you don't have it, or it will be taken away. This lets you select the key you need (especially useful in maps with missing keys).

`IDK`  
Gives all keys.

`WEAP`  
Type WEAP, then type a number (`1-9` in Doom 2, `1-8` in Doom). The selected weapon which is associated with that slot will either be added or removed, depending on whether you have it or not.

`AMMO`  
Type AMMO, then either type a number from `1-4`, or `B` for Backpack. The selected ammo will be added or taken away. Ammo types are bullets, shells, rockets, and cells.

`TRAN` or `MBFRAN`  
This code toggles translucency rendering effects.

`PITCH`  
Toggles pitched sounds (the "pitch-shifted sounds" option in General menu).

`ICE`  
Toggle Boom friction effects.

`PUSH`  
Toggle Boom pusher effects.

`NUKE`  
Toggle the effects of damaging sectors.
