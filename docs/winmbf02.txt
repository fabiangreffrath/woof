* Description *          

This is the first, highly-requested port of the pure MBF source to Win32. It
uses system code from the Eternity Engine (http://doomworld.com/eternity) and
is therefore supported by the SDL library.

What's New:
You can now select Nightmare mode from the main menu without crashing the game.


* Copyright / Permissions *

Please see the file COPYING to read the license for this program and its source
code. It is covered under the terms of the GNU GPL, and no warranties are given
for this software.


* Misc. Information *

This is unsupported software and will not be actively maintained. Expect a few
possible updates in the future, but they will not be frequent. Please do not
request any known MBF bugs in this port to be fixed, and do not submit feature
requests. If you want bug fixes and new features, please consider using the
Eternity Engine instead.

That said, please feel free to use this port as a bed for Eternity Engine
regression testing. If behaviors differ between Eternity and WinMBF in ways
that you suspect are due to an error in Eternity, please contact us (you can
find Quasar's email address at the page mentioned above).

Do not under any circumstances attempt to contact Lee Killough about this
version of MBF; he was not involved in its creation and will not provide any
support for it. Please do thank him for the wonderful gift that MBF was,
though :)


* Changes from MBF *

New Command-line Options:

* -heapsize: Specify a size between 8 and 255 MB; MBF will attempt to allocate
  this amount of memory. The default heap size is 8 MB. The upper limit of
  255 MB is a Windows limitation.

* -fullscreen: Enables fullscreen video mode support. This cannot currently be
  toggled while the program is running.


New Configuration Options:

* The joystick can be configured via the config file. You can specify the 
  device number (the first joystick on your system should be number 0), and
  provide sensitivity values for either axis.
  
* Wait at exit: toggle this on or off to give time for you to read any error
  messages that may appear in WinMBF's console window. Default is on.
  
* Force flip pan: you can force reversal of the stereo audio channels if they
  are backwards on your machine.


Bug Fixes/Code Changes:

* Massive portability adjustments. All GNU C extensions macroized or removed.
  Visual C++ support, some warnings fixed (most not).

* DOS code removed. This build is for SDL platforms only, and has only been
  built under Windows. Use the original source or binaries if you need DOS 
  support.

* DeHackEd support will not cause a crash by trying to close a NULL file
  pointer (applies under Windows only).
  
* Files will be written to the current working directory, not the root 
  directory, if the program is not started by the operating system with a full
  path name (affects Windows XP).
  
* M_InitExtendedHelp no longer writes into a string constant.

* M_Drawer no longer writes into a string constant. Fixes crash when trying to
  play in Nightmare mode, among other possible errors.
  

Known Problems:

* No netcode yet. Should be much easier to put in than it will be for Eternity.

* Spectre fuzz is still wrong. The MBF source online doesn't have this fixed,
  so it's not fixed here either. I'll probably repair this in a future build.
  
* Writing out the internal resources to a wad file is currently disabled. This
  code uses the poorly supported open function and needs to be changed to use
  the ANSI stdio functions.

* Stability issues. Program has crashed with no error message, so expect some
  problems. Save your game often. These are probably BOOM/MBF bugs and not
  issues introduced during porting.

* Print Screen key doesn't work for screenshots under Windows. You can change
  this to another key code (they use ASCII codes) in the config file, or you
  can use -devparm to enable screenshots using the F1 key. Numpad * key is
  also currently disabled -- this may be fixed in a future build.
