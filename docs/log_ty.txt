Ty Halderman - change log and diary

6/01/98

Altered a pointer assignment statement for compatibility with GCC v2.8.1

5/17/98

Fixed a bug that would process the last line of each deh/bex file twice.

5/16/98

Added a NULL entry to the code pointer mnemonics to allow an already
existing code pointer to be cleared with BEX codepointers.  Also fixed
a bad looping logic in that area that would have caused segv's if it
had encountered invalid BEX Codepointer entries in a file.
Affected: D_DEH.C, BOOMDEH.TXT

5/4/98

Completed reformatting and commenting of my assigned files, except for some
that are shared that I'm the last one in line for. 

Added support in BEX strings for the savegamename prefix (default boomsav)
so that TC's can have their own savegames (and people can have sets of
them without having to make subdirs if desired).
Affected: G_GAME.C, D_DEH.C, D_DEH.H, DSTRINGS.H, BOOMDEH.TXT

4/26/98

Added mnemonic support for code pointer changing in BEX files.  This will
allow anyone to plug any of the code pointers in by a readable name, not 
only into the existing frames where pointers are used, but into any of the
frames.  BOOMDEH.TXT expanded considerably with a full table of all existing
default code pointers in the engine.
Affected: D_DEH.C, BOOMDEH.TXT, BOOM.TXT

4/24/98

Fixed a bug in multiple string reading from a .BEX file if the continuation
strings started with a blank.  This was advertised to be able to work, 
with leading blanks removed during string concatenation, but it was
broken.
Affected: D_DEH.C

Put strings back to deh-modifiable for GAMMALVL0-4, which were removed
sometime around 3/23 during a merge.
Affected: M_MENU.C

Re-removed IDK cheat.
Affected: ST_STUFF.C

Removed some "draft" comments from BOOMDEH.TXT
Affected: BOOMDEH.TXT

Updated DEEP97 information and some of the Dehacked support info in the
BOOM.TXT file.  Updated the date at the top to 4/24/98.
Affected: BOOM.TXT

4/11/98

Changes based on sources as of 9:32AM 11 Apr

Fixed Par times entry [PARS] for bex format, documented it in BOOMDEH.
Corrected logic in WI_STUFF.C to show pars unless there is a pwad but
no deh pars patch.  Found silly problem due to zero-based arrays for
DOOM2, 1-based for DOOM.
Affected: WI_STUFF.C, D_DEH.C

Removed IDK cheat and replaced it with TNTKA to give all keys.  cheat_k()
is still used, but no longer displays its own message, and IDK can't invoke
it separately.  Per email earlier:
People were having problems with this because of dehacked patches that 
expected to be able to change the IDKFA cheat but IDK would trigger first.
Affected: ST_STUFF.C

Added the ability to load consecutive DEH/BEX files at the command line.
Each one is still given a default extension of BEX, then DEH if not
specified on the command line.  Changed the point at which the DEHOUT.TXT
file is erased so it'll hold all of one session's entries.  Added a 
line to that log file, identifying the file path being loaded.
Affected: D_MAIN.C

Added INCLUDE capability in BEX files, no nesting, with the optional 
parameter NOTEXT.  The notext flag says to ignore any DEH-style text blocks, 
since they've probably been redone in BEX and we just want the other
stuff.  Note that text changes are cumulative other than sprite names and
such.  If you change X to Y and then try to change X to Z, it won't 
find X any more because it's now Y.
Affected: D_DEH.C

Note that comments about BEX design down around 3/20 in this file are not
the way it was implemented after all.

Documented use of INCLUDE, PARS and the new banner strings STARTUPn.
Affected: BOOMDEH.TXT

4/7/98

Added the logic to go searching through the default strings for text changes,
if found in the old DEH style.  This should be a stopgap fix to handle lots
of text changes, so long as they are supported as valid things to change in 
BOOM.  Should be transparent to the users--text hacks will just start working.
Also fixed par times settings, new in BOOM.  More docs coming later.

3/30/98

Fixed up the text change stuff using the [STRINGS] block separator.  There is
now a big descriptive file BOOMDEH.TXT that contains information on all 300+
strings that can be changed.

Found a bug where the included \n in a string read in wasn't being changed
to a real linefeed, so entries which were supposed to split lines wouldn't.

Added new entries in the [STRINGS] area to change the background tiled flat
textures for behind the intermission texts.

3/27/98 

Finally got the deh changes in that I think are needed to complete this 
monster.  The usual DEH files seem to work ok, and I've got the arrays built
to be able to implement the externalized text strings, etc (see 3/20 specs).
The main goal of this run is to merge the changes so far, so we're all caught
up.  More work tomorrow on making the functions work right and creating several
test deh files.

3/20/98 

Designed bex format for new text and extension entries (this will go in a 
separate doc later):

1.  Replacement level names in the automap:

        [LEVELS]
        ExMx = text
        MAPxx = text

2.  Replacement sprite names

        [SPRITES]
        TROO = IMPY
        # 4-character sprite names can be replaced by another 4-character name
        # Only a full 4-character name will be accepted for key or value, and
        # it is the _original_ entry that will be checked for replacement.  There
        # won't be any cascading effect, so you could successfully use:
        TROO = POSS
        POSS = SPOS
        SPOS = TROO
        # and not have any problems with it.

3.  Replacement sound names

        [SOUNDS]
        PSTOP = platwhoa
        PSTART = platgo
        BSPWLK = tread1
        BAREXP = Zowie
        # The key must be the name of a sound entry in DOOM, without the
        # leading "S_" (ignored if present).  "P_" PC sounds aren't supported 
        # at this time.

4.  Replacement music names

        [MUSICS]
        E1M1 = mymusic
        BUNNY = rabbitsong
        MAP04 = fred
        # Valid keys for DOOM2 music can be either the actual names
        # used there, such as THE_DA and DDTBLU, or the relative names
        # for the levels they go with, MAP06 and MAP08 in this example.
        # Various non-level names must be entered based on the name of
        # the entry in DOOM.  The leading "D_" is optional and will be
        # ignored if present.

5.  Replacement messages

        [MESSAGES]
        # Several kinds of these, used at the various logical places
        # Initially they will only replace the existing ones--with scripting
        # we will be able to add new entries, and call them in the script.
        # This message will appear between MAP06 and MAP07.  Perhaps if there's
        # time a more logical name can be used--for now it's what DOOM uses
        # in the code.
        C1TEXT = "The end has arrived.\n\nThis is the biggest \"
                        "thing you have ever seen\n\n\n\n...and you're scared."
        # Note \n is used to force a linefeed, and a trailing backslash
        # on a line will concatenate the next line after stripping leading
        # whitespace.  If you want a blank between the parts of a line, use
        # a space before the backslash, as shown above with "biggest \"
        GOTREDCARD = "Got a maroon computer thingy"
        PD_BLUEO = "You need that blue gadget or you can't use this"
        GAMMALVL4 = "This is way bright now"
        QSPROMPT = "quicksave over your game named\n\n'%s'?\n\nHit Y or N."

6.  Par times

        [PARS]

7.  Cheats

        [CHEATS]
        GODMODE = IDdqdWasSilly

8.  Monster Roster (cast) names
        [CAST]
        CC_BARON = "Harvey Wallbanger"

9.  Code Pointers, alternative
        [CODEPOINTER]
        Frame 245 = scream
        332 = explode
        # "Frame" is optional.  The name in the value is the name of the function
        # that is actually called (list provided, no guessing <g>).  Future additions
        # of new code pointer routines can be handled here as well.


3/18/98

Adding text support for level names and end messages.  Currently requires 
a change to the format of the file, but there will be a utility written to
handle a one-way modification to a .deh file to make it work with the new 
system.  Either a .deh or new .bex file extension can be used.  Boom EXtensions 
are allowed in either one, but it's easier for the author to tell which is a 
"pure" dehacked patch.  

        Modules affected: D_DEH.C, D_MAIN.C

Initial new deh extension logic inserted--unfinished merge

Added par time modification, usage explained in sample.bex

        Modules affected: D_DEH.C

Modified WI_STUFF.C to allow a dehacked par time patch to turn par times back 
on (they are normally off when a pwad is loaded)

Modified WI_STUFF.C to allow frag counts up to +/- 999

Modified P_SPEC.C to handle -frags nn counter, default 10 frags if not otherwise 
specified.

Note to self: there are switch name pairs in P_SWITCH.C


3/15/98

Fixed The Big Bug where the Thing number was off by one relative to its index in 
the structures.  A pox on base 1 programming in a base 0 language!


3/9/98

Added dehacked file support.  Added new module D_DEH.C.

Usage:  -deh filename[.deh]

The file is assumed to be a patch version 6 dehacked file for
DOOM version 1.9.  No validation is done of that.  Caveat haquor.

 -      New link made to recognize the -deh command-line parameter.

        Modules affected: D_MAIN.C

 -      The Misc entries were direct hacks into several places in 
        the code where hardcoded entries were used.  To change these
        required adding global ints and in some cases changing
        #defines to use ints instead (MAXHEALTH, BFGCELLS).  The 
        uppercase values have been #define'd to the variables.

        Modules affected: 
                P_PSPR.C for BFGCELLS, 
                ST_STUFF.C for things that are given for cheat codes,
                P_INTER.C for the rest of them.  

 -      Moved MAXHEALTH out of P_LOCAL.H into P_INTER.C and made it a
        variable 

 -      Added d_deh.c stuff to makefile

Limitations on text substitution have forced a rethink of that--it won't be in
the 3/9/98 build.
