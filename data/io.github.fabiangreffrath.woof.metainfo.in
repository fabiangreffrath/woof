    <p>
      Woof! is a continuation of Lee Killough's Doom source port MBF
      targeted at modern systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      MBF stands for "Marine's Best Friend" and is widely regarded as
      the successor of the Boom source port by TeamTNT. It serves as the
      code base for popular Doom source ports such as PrBoom+/DSDA-Doom or
      The Eternity Engine. As the original engine was limited to run only
      under MS-DOS, it has been ported to Windows by Team Eternity under the
      name WinMBF in 2004. Woof! is developed based on the WinMBF code with
      the aim to make MBF more widely available and convenient to use on
      modern systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      To achieve this goal, this source port is less strict regarding
      its faithfulness to the original MBF. It is focused on quality-of-life
      enhancements, bug fixes and compatibility improvements. However, all
      changes have been introduced in good faith that they are in line with
      the original author's intentions and even for the trained eye, this
      source port should still look very familiar to the original MBF.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, this project's goal is to fast-forward MBF.EXE from
      DOS to 21st century and remove all the stumbling blocks on the way.
      Furthermore, just as MBF was ahead of its time, this project dedicates
      itself to early adoption of new modding features such as
      DEHEXTRA+DSDHacked, UMAPINFO and MBF21.
