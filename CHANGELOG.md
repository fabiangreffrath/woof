## New Features and Improvements
* Don't draw status bar or any other UI in savegame snapshots.
* Add "Walk Under Solid Hanging Bodies" feature from PrBoom+.
* Support face gib animations in the status bar widget as in the 3DO/Jaguar/PSX ports (graphics lumps need to occupy the `STFXDTH0` to `STFXDTH9` name space).
* Allow COMP cheat to change complevel in-game (report current complevel when entered, expecting two-digit new complevel argument).
* Allow the SSG in Doom 1 if the corresponding assets are available.
* Implement SDL-native sound looping for moving walls (removing clicking noise between sounds).
* Have "Clear Marks" key clear just the last mark in the Automap (by @MrAlaux).
* Limit the number of identical sounds playing at once, based on priority ordering (based on code from Odamex and DSDA-Doom).
* Make color of health and armor count gray in the status bar and HUD widgets when invulnerable (by @MrAlaux).
* Add VGA "porch" behaviour emulation from Chocolate Doom (enabled by `vga_porch_flash` key in the config file).
* Implement dark automap overlay (by @MrAlaux).
* Support dedicated music (lumps names `D_E4M1` to `D_E4M9`) for Episode 4 of Ultimate Doom. Also, support to select these tracks (and the music tracks for UMAPINFO maps) by the IDMUS cheat.
* Implement crosshair target lock-on (by @MrAlaux).
* Increase internal maximum horizontal resolution to 1152. This is meant to add support for non-exactly 21:9 screens, such as 3840x1600 (WQHD+).
* Implement crosshair coloring by target health (by @MrAlaux).
* Windows native MIDI player improvements:
  - Support for SysEx messages.
  - Correctly reset MIDI devices with SysEx messages. Default is GS mode, can be changed with the `winmm_reset_type` config option (by @ceski-1).
  - The reset delay is configurable using the `winmm_reset_delay` config parameter. Useful for vintage MIDI devices (by @ceski-1).
  - Implement a "capital tone fallback" emulation that allows MS GS Wavetable Synth, Roland SCVA, Roland SC-55mkII and later devices to work in GS mode without any issues (by @ceski-1).
  - Fix looping timing, various optimizations (by @ceski-1).
  - Add full support for EMIDI, extensions used in Build engine games (by @ceski-1).
  - Implement Final Fantasy and RPG Maker loop points (by @ceski-1).
* No need to restart the program to change MIDI player.
* Ability to select Windows MIDI device in the menu.
* Scan the `soundfonts` folder and show all found `.sf2` and `.sf3` soundfonts in the menu.
* OPL emulation output gain. Allows increase the OPL volume with the `opl_gain` config option (default 200%).
* Allow parsing of cosmetic items in the `OPTIONS` lump for all complevels.
* Enable doubled card and skull key display on status bar by default.
* Gamepad analog controls improvemets:
  - The turning/looking speed does not depend on the run key.
  - Ability to invert each axis separately.
  - Separate sensitivity for movement, turning and looking.
  - Possibility to disable the axis (choose "None" in the menu).
  - Do not allow simultaneous use of mouse and controller in strictmode when recording demo (new DSDA rule).
* Unify gamma correction: classic lighter gamma levels with added intermediate levels, generated darker levels.

## Bug Fixes
* Take into account "smooth diminishing lighting" for "level brightness" feature.
* Set 'fastdemo_timer' to false before warping (by @rrPKrr).
* Fix starting "new game" or "load game" when fast-forwarding a demo.
* Do not switch timer if fastdemo is not enabled.
* Fix midi_player config setting description.
* Fix background drawing on screen size 3 in 21:9 widescreen mode.
* UMAPINFO: Don't show menu for only one episode.
* Fix "Show Demo Progress Bar" being disabled in the menu instead of "Default Compatibility" if the `-complevel` command-line parameter was used (by @MrAlaux).
* Do not allow autoloading in shareware gamemode.
* An IWAD called `doom1.wad` is now always checked for its content instead of blindly assuming the shareware IWAD.
* Fix NULL string comparison in DEH parser.
* Fix skull position in the help screen for Doom 2.
* UMAPINFO: Provide a default map progression if neither `next` nor `endpic` are set.
* Add the missing OPUS DLLs to the 32-bit build.
