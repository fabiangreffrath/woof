.SH SYNOPSIS
.B woof
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
MBF stands for "Marine's Best Friend" and is widely regarded the successor
of the Boom source port by TeamTNT. It serves as the code base for popular
Doom source ports such as PrBoom+/DSDA-Doom or The Eternity Engine. As the
original engine was limited to run only under MS-DOS, it has been ported to
Windows by Team Eternity under the name WinMBF in 2004. Woof! is developed
based on the WinMBF code with the aim to make MBF more widely available and
convenient to use on modern systems.
