Description             : As Boomedit was for Boom, MBFedit shall be for MBF.
                        : And it was good, and the people were happy.
Special Thanks to       : Lee and Rez for their suggestions, it wouldn't be
                        : half the WAD it currently is without their input.
Additional Credits to   : Rogue and Raven for not suing over the Strife and
                          Hexen stuff I stole.
                        : Rez for beta testing this mess.:)
                        : Lee Killough for the MBF engine.
                        : TeamTNT for the Boom engine.
                        : Id Software for the Doom engine.
                        : End of the line.:)
Command line            : MBF -file mbfedit! or something similar. 
                        : No other external stuff needed.
=============================================================================

Get freaky! Get freaky! Everybody in the house get freaky!

== Construction =============================================================
Base           : New level from scratch
Editor(s) used : DCK 3.62, DCK 2.2f, Wintex, Microsoft paint....
Build Time     : Several hundred repetitions of my music collection.
Known Bugs     : You think I make bug-ridden WADs? Ha! I mock you!

== Copyright / Permissions ==================================================
Authors MAY use this level as a base to build additional levels, if they
send me a nice e-mail or name their firstborn after me.:)

You MAY distribute this WAD provided you include this file, with no
modifications.  You MAY distribute this file in any electronic format
(BBS, Diskette, CD, etc.) as long as you include this file intact. I also
suggest that you let me know about it, or I'll send my goons after you.

== Where to get this WAD ====================================================
Dunno. Probably the same place you got the text file. Look around, it
should be real close to MBF.

== Long Explanation for People Brave Enough to Read this Far ================
Okay, finally, a UAC Base not completely taken over by Hellspawn! Just a
couple of Imps or Cyberdemons or mutant Commander Keens or something like
that, I can't remember. Look around, take a couple of lessons in MBF physics.
Read the signs carefully, and when you're done, nip out the back door to
finish the level.

I'll give a short teaser on some of the rooms, in whatever order I feel like:

Outside: Not really a room, but what the heck. Shows some high-friction nukage
and low-friction ice. These are a bit extreme examples of MBF friction, WAD
authors might want to use more middle-of-the-road settings.

Note how the imps - and dogs, if you take them along - have fun trying to walk
around, as they're also affected.

Grenade testing range: See Grenade fly. See Grenade bounce. See how Grenade
goes up stairs, over small barricades, and around corners. See Grenade blow
up and kill stupid marines who don't stand back. This room will give you a
better idea of how to use grenades, should you ever want to use GRENADE.DEH
(from EXAMPLES.ZIP) for spicing up regular levels, or for a WAD of yours.

Physics 101: Hit the switch, watch torque make the dead imp fall from his
now unstable perch.

Physics 201: Hit the switch, and enjoy slightly more advanced uses of torque.
No conveyors here, folks.

Unstable reactor waste: Hit the switch, watch torque make the barrel fall
from its now unstable perch. But the torque isn't the big thing here, it's
the TOUCHY DeHackEd flag I put on the barrel. Watch and learn.

Wind tunnel: Not only does friction now effect monsters, but the wind does too.

Stained Glass storage: A bit of a steal from Boomedit, but with a smoother
twist. One side of the door is a fast (blazing) door trigger, one is a normal
trigger, so you can see the effect at different speeds. Watch the room's
lighting as the door moves.

Reactor control room: My, my. Doesn't that little valve look harmless, an
easy kill.

Suicide Counseling: No comment. We all need a bit of suspense in our lives.:)
